# Tip Calculator
Tip calculator is a SwiftUi program.

## Swift App 1
Iâ€™m on a journey to learn swift better. I built my Library App and got a little stuck on it so I am going through the tutorials on hacking with swift to learn hands on anything to add to it or get me thinking of other ways to do certain functions.

On this tutorial it was just a recap of views and states that I have already used. But refreshers are always great.
